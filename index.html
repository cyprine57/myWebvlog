        <h2>Their origin!</h2>
        <p>
          Cats have been with humans for thousands of years. They were first
          domesticated around 4,000 years ago in Egypt, where they were valued
          for protecting grain stores from rodents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, they became symbols of grace and companionship across many
          cultures.
